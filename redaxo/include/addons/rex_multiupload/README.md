Redaxo multiple upload utility (rex_multiupload)
=========

Redaxo &quot;Multiupload&quot; AddOn

How to install:
Download the package, _rename the folder to **"rex_multiupload"**_ (without quotes) and upload it into your REDAXO AddOn dir.
If you leave the folder name unchanged the addon will alter you an notification and will try to fix the problem automagically ;)

--

New in this version: realtime edit with ajax. After the upload has finished, you're able to modify any metainfo.
Change title, description or any other kind of metainfo. You can also delete a file immediately.

Notes:
- multiupload will now remember last synced cat (behaves like you already know from redaxo)
- improved layout and css
- mediapool-page is now update-stable (uses EP to inject the page, no patching-file required anymore)
- and a lot more.... have fun!!
